# HyperTerm Lastpass

> Lastpass plugin for autofilling passwords in HyperTerm.

## About

I have admired [`hyperterm-1password`][1] because it seemed like such a cool
idea, but I have always used Lastpass! This made me quite jealous, so I went
ahead and created [`lastpass-node`][2] because there were no Node.js clients yet
for Lastpass (_sigh_). Then I created this cool plugin! Finally, an easy way to
fill in my passwords easily with HyperTerm ðŸŽ‰

Lastpass vaults are stored locally and are encrypted. The plugin will try to
clear decrypted accounts from memory as soon as possible, too.

arise due to using this plugin.**

### How to use

1.  Either click the `Plugins > Lastpass` menu item or use `Cmd or Ctrl + L`.
2.  Enter your Lastpass username and password.
3.  If you need to enter a 2 factor authentication pin, enter it.
4.  Search for the password you want to enter.
5.  Click on the row you would like to autofill a password with.
6.  ????
7.  PROFIT!!!

### Caveats

There's currently no way of updating your Lastpass vault locally. The vaults are
stored to `~/.lastpass-vault-${USERNAME}`, delete the vault you'd like to update
and re-login to update the vault.
